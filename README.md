# Weather Forecast Project üå§Ô∏è

## Project Overview
The **Weather Forecast Project** is a Python-based application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The project demonstrates data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and deployment of a live web application.

This project showcases skills in:
- Python programming
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- API integration
- Data visualization
- Deployment of a web application

---

## Project Live
The project is live and can be accessed here: [**Streamline Weather Forecast**](https://pro-weather-aqi-dashboard-xtbjpiv8uwftmnmznvambh.streamlit.app/)

---

## Features
- Fetch current weather data for any city worldwide.
- Display temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather description.
- Clean and structured display of the data.
- Live updates via API integration.
- Simple, user-friendly interface.

---

## Data Source
- Weather data is collected from **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current)**.
- API Key used: `10b0b3741256c3d840ad164ba3cba2c8`  
- Data collected includes:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Wind Speed
  - Weather Condition

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected city list from OpenWeatherMap JSON file: `city.list.json`.
- Used OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data for selected cities.
- Stored data in structured format for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values or corrupted entries.
- Removed duplicates if any.
- Standardized column names and formats.
- Converted temperature from Kelvin to Celsius for readability.

### 3. Data Analysis & Visualization
- Extracted important weather metrics:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Wind Speed
- Visualized metrics using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Temperature trends
  - Humidity comparison
  - Wind speed variations

### 4. Deployment
- Python Flask framework used to create a simple web interface.
- Hosted the application live on **Streamline** platform.
- User can input any city and get live weather updates instantly.
